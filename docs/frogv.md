This layout inspired by [@konomu's implementation](https://github.com/konomu/qmk_firmware/tree/frogpad/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/frogpad) and the [FrogPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrogPad) keyboard.

## Rationale

I've been working on a new one-handed keyboard layout with just 18 keys. I initially did this for fun, but it turns out it's so useful that it's now a part of my daily computing habits! It's called the <mark>FrogV layout</mark> and here's what it looks like.

## What do I use it for?

I programmed my keyboard to allow toggling FrogV mode with a hotkey. This allows me to use my keyboard as both a regular keyboard and a one-handed keyboard. I often turn on one-handed mode for these cases:

- **Casual browsing** &mdash; When I'm using the browser to read and browse, I don't type much and I mostly use the arrow keys to navigate.

- **Figma** &mdash; I can use all of its keyboard shortcuts with my left hand, so my right hand never has to put my mouse down. I might sometimes switch to the regular two-handed keyboard when typing layer names and filling in text.
